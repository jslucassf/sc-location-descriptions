# Location Descriptions Data

This repository contains data produced by an experiment that had people describe the location of some places.

## Experiment summary:
In this study, 57 volunteers, their identities concealed, described 10 different locations within the city of _Campina Grande_ in Brazil, selected by the researchers. Before conducting the experiments, a few descriptions for some randomly chosen places were written by the researchers and based on the time spent on this task, an estimate was made that two minutes would be an adequate time for the descriptions to be produced without putting pressure on the participants. For this reason, they were given two minutes to produce each description. 

Through a questionnaire, participants informed gender; age; whether they live or have ever lived in the city; and level of knowledge about the city (in a scale of 0 to 10).

Respondents were asked to imagine a situation where they were standing at the given place and needed to describe the location to a friend, so that the friend could reach the location and pick them up for a ride. To prevent the situation where participants would use a more formal language, due to the fact they were writing (instead of speaking) and because they were participating in a research experiment at a university, they were instructed to describe the locations using the language they use daily with friends and family,
